Total Presentation Time: 5 minutes 35 seconds - 6 minutes 15 seconds

================================================================================

SLIDE 1: TITLE SLIDE
Duration: 15-20 seconds

Script:
"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Today we'll be presenting our research on how Proof-of-Humanity protocols can address the identity crisis created by Artificial General Intelligence. I'm [Your Name], and I'm here with [Team Members]. We're from the Data Analytics specialization, and this research was conducted as part of our Research Methodology course."

================================================================================

SLIDE 2: PROBLEM STATEMENT & CONTEXT
Duration: 40-45 seconds

Script:
"Think of it like this: imagine trying to prove you're not a robot, but the robots are now smarter than you at solving those 'I'm not a robot' tests. That's our reality today. Modern AI systems can solve CAPTCHAs better than humans, create convincing deepfakes that fool facial recognition, and even generate fake social media profiles that look authentic. This creates a fundamental problem: how do we maintain trust in digital systems when we can't reliably tell humans from AI? This matters for everything from voting systems to social media to financial transactions. Without solving this, we risk AI-driven manipulation of democratic processes and complete erosion of trust in digital institutions."

================================================================================

SLIDE 3: THE PROOF OF PERSONHOOD TRILEMMA
Duration: 40-45 seconds

Script:
"Here's the core challenge we call the 'Proof of Personhood Trilemma.' Think of it like a triangle where you need all three corners, but current systems can only reach two. For example, Worldcoin uses iris scans—very secure against AI attacks and it can scale, but it requires centralized data collection, creating surveillance risks. On the other hand, BrightID uses social connections—it's decentralized and scalable, but AI can slowly build fake social networks over time to fool the system. It's like trying to design a lock that's unpickable, works for millions of doors, and doesn't require a master key—each improvement in one area weakens another."

================================================================================

SLIDE 4: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
Duration: 35-40 seconds

Script:
"Our research followed a systematic three-phase approach over 10 weeks. First, we conducted a comprehensive literature review, analyzing 12 key studies to understand existing vulnerabilities. We documented exactly how AGI systems break current security measures. Second, we designed three completely new protocols that combine different technologies to address these weaknesses. Finally, we developed an evaluation framework to systematically compare these protocols across security, performance, usability, and deployment feasibility. We weighted security at 40% because it's the most critical factor, with performance at 25%, usability at 20%, and deployment feasibility at 15%."

================================================================================

SLIDE 5: LITERATURE REVIEW - KEY FINDINGS
Duration: 35-40 seconds

Script:
"Our literature review revealed alarming vulnerabilities. CAPTCHA systems are essentially dead—AI doesn't just solve them well, it solves them better than humans. Imagine a security system that locks out more legitimate users than intruders. Biometric systems face sophisticated deepfake attacks where AI generates fake fingerprints or faces that fool sensors. Social verification systems, which rely on your network of friends vouching for you, can be defeated by AI patiently building fake relationships over months or years. Even behavioral biometrics—analyzing how you type or move your mouse—can be replicated by machine learning. Every single current approach has fundamental weaknesses against AGI."

================================================================================

SLIDE 6: OUR THREE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS
Duration: 50-55 seconds

Script:
"We developed three complementary solutions, each optimized for different scenarios. Think of them like different types of locks for different security needs.

PMAP is like a bank vault—it uses specialized hardware chips that create a secure environment even on compromised devices, combined with cryptographic techniques that let you prove you're human without revealing your identity. It's ideal for financial systems where privacy and security are paramount.

HAP is like a modern airport security system—it checks you three different ways simultaneously. AI would need to defeat your biometric scan, forge your social connections, AND replicate your behavioral patterns all at once. This makes attacks exponentially more difficult and is perfect for social media platforms.

DAP is like a community watch program—instead of one central authority, you have distributed auditors who independently verify identities and are financially rewarded for honest behavior but penalized for fraud. This achieves maximum decentralization, making it ideal for voting systems where centralized control is unacceptable."

================================================================================

SLIDE 7: COMPARATIVE RESULTS
Duration: 45-50 seconds

Script:
"Our evaluation revealed distinct strengths for each protocol. HAP scored highest overall at 7.3 because it's the most balanced—it doesn't excel at any single thing but performs well across all dimensions, making it suitable for general use. Think of it as the Swiss Army knife of identity verification.

PMAP achieved the highest security score at 8.3 out of 10, with exceptional privacy protection at 9.5. It's like a specialized surgical tool—perfect for specific high-stakes applications like banking, even if it's not as easy to use.

DAP scored highest in decentralization at 9.0, completely eliminating centralized control, but faces scalability challenges. It's ideal for scenarios where preventing censorship and centralized control is more important than raw performance—like in democratic voting systems or in countries with authoritarian governments.

Importantly, all three protocols significantly advance beyond current systems by achieving strong performance across all three trilemma dimensions simultaneously."

================================================================================

SLIDE 8: REAL-WORLD IMPLICATIONS
Duration: 40-45 seconds

Script:
"The stakes here couldn't be higher. Without AGI-resistant identity verification, we face several catastrophic scenarios. Imagine elections where bots outnumber real voters, swaying outcomes through manufactured consensus. Social media platforms where you literally can't tell if you're talking to humans or AI. Financial systems where identity fraud becomes trivial at industrial scale.

But we must deploy these solutions ethically. PMAP requires specialized hardware that could exclude low-income users—we need universal access programs. Any identity system could theoretically enable surveillance—we need strong legal protections and transparency requirements. And decentralized systems must still accommodate legitimate law enforcement needs without enabling authoritarianism. The technology is only half the solution; governance and ethics are equally critical."

================================================================================

SLIDE 9: LIMITATIONS & FUTURE RESEARCH
Duration: 35-40 seconds

Script:
"We must be transparent about limitations. These protocols are currently theoretical—they exist on paper, not in production systems. Real-world implementation may reveal challenges we haven't anticipated. PMAP's hardware requirements create potential inequality if not addressed through subsidies or alternatives. And as AI continues advancing, these protocols will require continuous evolution—this isn't a one-time fix but an ongoing arms race.

Future research needs to focus on building and testing actual working systems, adapting these protocols to be quantum-resistant as quantum computers emerge, developing comprehensive governance frameworks that balance security with civil liberties, and conducting long-term studies on how people actually adopt and use these systems in practice."

================================================================================

SLIDE 10: CONCLUSION & KEY TAKEAWAYS
Duration: 40-45 seconds

Script:
"To conclude, our research demonstrates that protecting human digital identity in the AGI era is both technically feasible and practically achievable. We've made four key contributions: thoroughly documenting vulnerabilities in existing systems, designing three novel protocols that address these weaknesses, creating a replicable evaluation methodology, and showing that while the Proof of Personhood Trilemma persists, we can make substantial progress toward solving it.

The path forward requires production implementation, continuous security evolution, thoughtful governance, and unwavering commitment to equity and privacy. The technology exists—now we need the will and coordination to deploy it responsibly. Digital identity verification is foundational infrastructure for democracy, economy, and social interaction. Getting this right isn't optional—it's essential for preserving human agency in an AI-mediated world. Thank you for your attention. We're happy to take questions."

================================================================================

SLIDE 11: TECHNICAL DEEP-DIVE - PMAP ARCHITECTURE (BACKUP SLIDE)
Duration: 30-35 seconds

Script:
"If you're wondering how PMAP actually works technically: imagine your phone has a secure chip that's isolated from everything else—even if your phone is hacked, this chip can't be compromised. Your biometric data goes into this chip and never leaves. The chip generates a mathematical proof that says 'I have a valid credential' without revealing what that credential is or who you are. This proof gets recorded on a distributed ledger, similar to blockchain. When you need to verify your identity later, you generate a new proof from the same chip. The verifier can confirm you're human without ever seeing your biometric data or learning your identity. It's like showing you have a valid ID without actually showing the ID itself."
